Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of the analysis for temperatures in Hawaii was to determine whether the weather will adversely affect the success of the surf shop.

Results:

* The temperatures in December were only slightly cooler than the termperature in June
* The weather should not adversely affect the surf shop
* The ice cream part of the surf shop might not be as successful in the winter months as temperatures are roughly 10 degrees cooler than in June 

Summary:

The surf and ice cream shop has no reason to not be successful - despite the slight cool down in winter, temperatures in Hawaii stay mostly constant year round.
